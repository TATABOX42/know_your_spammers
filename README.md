# Spam comment analysis in R

Text mining in R. Wordclouds and other awesome plots to characterize some behaviors.

## Post in my blog for context

Imagine login into your blog and find out more than hundred spam messages, not cool!. So, I am not letting the spammers win, so I decided to crack some patterns and try to understand/learn something about these little annoying bots.

For this post, I am performing spam comment analysis in R of 163 comments posted in my blog from August 4th to October 17th . I wish there would be more, but looks like they got already deleted in the database. Additionally, I am including a dump in CSV and the code (bottom section).
