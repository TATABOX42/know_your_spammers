Text mining in R. Wordclouds, Comparison clouds and awesome plots.

## Post in my blog for context

I was checking some Machine Learning challenges at Hackerrank and found a particular challenge which consist on document classification. The source is over here. I downloaded the dataset and decided to make my own text mining analysis instead. The dataset consist of 5485 documents distributed among 8 different classes, perfect to compute wordclouds and cool ggplots in R.
